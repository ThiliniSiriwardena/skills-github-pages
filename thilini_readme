Just wanted to note here the changes I made.

22.10.2024=> I deleted the mention of utterences in layout/posts as it gave a not found file error.(Later have to insert it again as it's a how comments are done(https://utteranc.es/)
      The link to Hello World blog post doesn't work only because it doesn't include "skills-github-pages/" in the URL.(I spent hours thinking there's something wrong with the page.)
